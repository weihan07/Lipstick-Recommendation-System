Since nowadays, people are becoming more fond of makeup. Makeup has become something that is 
normalized in our society as people of all ages are using makeup to make themselves look more 
presentable in front of other people. Makeup is used to hide a person’s imperfection and help them 
to be able to fit into society. Makeup can help a person to look more confident and enhance their 
appearance. At some point, makeup had become so embedded in our society as a normality for 
women. 

Big makeup products brands Dior, Maybelline, Sephora, Lancôme, Chanel, Estee Lauder and 
many more are constantly producing new products to attract customers to buy their products. With 
the advanced technology and research done by makeup products brands, they are able to create 
new items for their customers. Examples of makeup products are mascara, concealer, eyeliner, 
blush, lip gloss, brow pencil, lipstick and many more. These makeup products had been massively 
produced and sold due to demand from customers. Other than that, new makeup products are 
produced to satisfy the demand of customers.
